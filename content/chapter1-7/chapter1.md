# Chapter1 : Introduction
**Machine learning** consist of two parts:

* learn from  experience(history data)
* adapt to environments

In past, I usually confuse **Machine Learning** and **Data Mining**. *Data Mining* is an application of machine learning methods to large databases. But machine learning is also a part of artificial intelligence. Something is called to be "Intelligent" means it has the abiliy to **learn and adapter to changes**.

I don't think machine learning is just the execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of a model. It should also tell us how to select or create the model. **Learning** should not merely optimize the parameters of an known formular(model,hypothesis).

## Problem: 
### 1. What kind of learning algorithm (Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforement) do you think is most suitable for pattern formation (e-Mouse is used) task in our lab.? If we change the task to navigation issue?
A:I think we should understand what is supervised/unsupervised/reinforemen learning formally at first.(To be added).
Reinforement is the best choice I think. We don't have any history data to make prediction and the emouse won't get together automatically in the form of letter A. Instead, each emouse should take a sequence steps to form a pattern. It is what reinforement learning does. 

# Chapter2: Supervised Learning
##1. Definition lists
- #### Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) Dismension ($P67$)

:   The maximum number of points that can be shattered by
$\mathcal{H}$, is denoted as $VC(\mathcal{H})$, and 
measures the capacity of $\mathcal{H}$.
